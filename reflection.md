# Milestone 5 - Destiny Bonillas

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
* For Milestone 5 my partner and I worked together to solve each aspect of the milestone,
we each took times doing the coding and problem solving when we ran into failed tests.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
* The major challenge that stumped my partner and I for awhile was one of our failed tests when it expected the opponents to stay on screen after the game was over, it was more so an issue trying to figure out what the test was asking for then solving how to fix it

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
* This entire project has taught me so much, but for this milestone specifically I enjoyed working with the Animation class more and discovering how to utilize the functions within the class.


# Milestone 5


## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
* This milestone was a complete joint task. Usually we like to split a small task up and do most tasks together. This time we knocked out the project in two days, but it was some of the unit tests that we failed. 


## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.

* Usually we are able to solve unit test quite effectively. This time, we ran into a problem that we spent more than an hour trying to solve. After ending the session for the day and then coming back to it, we were able to solve the issue. It was a misinterpretation of what the milestone was calling for. We were making the entire screen white with writing “Game Over”. The milestone sill wanted us to keep the opponents on screen moving. 

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
* The most important Thing I learned during this part, was to read the logic and determine what aspect of the test we were failing and why. I didn’t specifically know what was wrong, but I had to challenge what I thought was true to eventually past test.
